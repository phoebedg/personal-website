    <span>I caught this morning morning’s minion, king-</span>
    <span>
      dom of daylight’s dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding
    </span>
    <span>Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding</span>
    <span>High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing</span>
    <span>In his ecstasy! Then off, off forth on swing,</span>
    <span>
      As a skate’s heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding
    </span>
    <span>Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding</span>
    <span>Stirred for a bird – the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!</span>
    <span>Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here</span>
    <span>Buckle AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion</span>
    <span>Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!</span>
    <span>No wonder of it: sheer plod makes plough down sillion</span>
    <span>Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear</span>
    <span>Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold vermillion.</span>
