    <span>"What is left to us women, but the realms of the unknown?"</span>
    <span className="personal__citation">- Philippa Gregory</span>

      “Before we were conceived, we existed in part as an egg in our mother's
      ovary.
    </span>
    <span>
      All the eggs a woman will ever carry form in her ovaries while she is a
      four-month-old fetus in the womb of her mother.
    </span>
    <span>
      This means our cellular life as an egg begins in the womb of our
      grandmother.
    </span>
    <span>
      Each of us spent five months in our grandmother's womb and she in turn
      formed within the womb of her grandmother.
    </span>
    <span>
      We vibrate to the rhythms of our mother's blood before she herself is
      born.
    </span>
    <span>
      And this pulse is the thread of blood that runs all the way back through
      the grandmothers to the first mother.”

      long to return.”
