        I am a full stack web developer with a passion for React. I started my
        career in development in 2018 when I quit my job in order to teach
        myself full-time. I joined a London-based JavaScript bootcamp in the
        summer of that year, and I now work as a consultant in central London,
        UK. I am currently on a project at a major supermarket, helping to build
        a new UI for their online groceries website. Aside from coding, my other
        interests include cooking, eating, watching Silicon Valley and spending
        time with my very large family.
